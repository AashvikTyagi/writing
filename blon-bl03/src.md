# BLON BL-03: in a sentence.
![earphones](assets/iems.avif)

I’d only ever seen ‘chi-fi’ IEMs from a distance before my bluetooth TWS earbuds broke, when I decided to try 'chi-fi' IEMs for the first time with the BLON BL-03, a ~<$30 pair of 10mm carbon diaphragm dynamic driver earbuds with a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz, impedance of 32Ω, and sensitivity of 102dB/mW, that had satisfied (questionable whether intentionally or otherwise) the community attention leading up to them a few years before, with another questionably intentional choice being the packaging, featuring 'belief', 'letmusicburn' and 'oppoty', having 'annotation' and 'music and driams' underneath&mdash; either genius marketing from a fan of alternate spelling or a classic typo <small>(in this age of free and accurate translation tech, really?)</small> but I love it, with love being something my ears have fallen in after listening to these&mdash; my review as not quite an audiophile is that I am astounded by the tuning, the forward bass and rumble, clear midrange, unfatiguing treble, and precise soundstage, with the above complemented by decent construction of slightly odd shape and interesting metal finish yet let down by sad stock silicon eartips which don’t change the fact that now here I am, noticing elements previously unheard in my most played of music, unexpectedly and effectively spoiled by these Chinese earphones, because earlier, life was simple but never ear-blowing, but now that I use the BLON BL03, I driam of oppoty _nightly_.
