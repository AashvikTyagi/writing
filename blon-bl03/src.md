# BLON BL-03

Iâ€™ve been a user of mass-produced bluetooth headphones for as long back as I can remember, blissfully unaware of the various sounds from the universe of in-ear monitors whose existence I had known from but a distance.

So when my earbuds broke, I decided to try 'chi-fi' IEMs for the first time and chose the BLON BL-03, a $30 pair of 10mm dynamic driver earbuds that had satisfied (questionable whether intentionally or otherwise) the community hype leading up to them a few years before.

Another questionably intentional choice was the packaging, which features the following words: 'belief', 'letmusicburn' and 'oppoty', with 'annotation' and 'music and driams' under. I know not whether this was genius marketing from a fan of alternate spelling or a classic typo <sub>(in the age of free and accurate translation tech, really?)</sub> but it's a hit. I love it.

Speaking of love, my ears have fallen in some! I'm no audiophile, but I can give a review, and it is that I am astounded. I really enjoy the BLON BL-03's tuning, with my personal realization as to very noticeable improvements being that the bass seems to envelopes my head in the best way. There's a whole new dimension to what I'm hearing&mdash; I notice things I've never heard in my most played of songs, and it's a privilege to listen using these.  
They're quite comfortable as well, and I while I don't know whether this is so because of the tuning or the fit, but they can stay in my ears for a long time without discomfort.

And now here I am, unexpectedly and effectively spoiled by these Chinese earphones. Earlier, life was simple but never ear-blowing. Now that I use the BLON BL03, I driam of oppoty _nightly_.
