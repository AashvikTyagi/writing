# A Brief History of Geek Code

Geek Code is an encoding first invented by Robert A. Hayden in 1993 and last officially updated (as of time of writing) in 1996.

It consists of a series of letters which represent different areas (for example, appearance, interests, and certain opinions) and symbols which represent 'extent' in those areas, with optional wannabe markers, ranging markers, and alternate responses.

The idea was for Geek Code to encompass all the attributes of a 'geek', and this code was widely exchanged within communities of self-appointed 'geeks', being pasted under signatures and into websites, mails, comments in code, and clothing.

Of course, being this old in an internet that moves so fast, it's now incredibly dated and rarely seen outside of programmers' "about me" sections. Here's mine:
